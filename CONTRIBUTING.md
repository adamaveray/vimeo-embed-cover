# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Before proceeding, please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Developing

[Node](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) are both required to develop & test the library. Once they are configured, run `npm install` from the repository root directory to install the required dependencies.

Code is automatically formatted by [Prettier](https://prettier.io). Formatting can be initiated manually with the command `npm run format`. See [the Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/watching-files.html) to enable file watching & live reformatting.

Unit tests are managed by [Jest](https://jestjs.io). Tests can be run with the command `npm test`.

## Submitting Changes

Before submitting changes, please ensure all code formatting passes validation with the command `npm run lint` and all tests pass with the command `npm test`.

To submit changes, please [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

Thank you for your contribution!
